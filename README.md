# Brazil's e-commerce platform Olist
The dataset has information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing orders from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes, and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

## Context
Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces, generously provided this dataset. Olist connects small businesses across Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants can sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store, a seller is notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note about the purchase experience and write down some comments.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
